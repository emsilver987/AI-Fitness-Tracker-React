# Fitness Tracker UI (React)

Welcome! This project is the **starting point** of a full-featured fitness tracking application I'm building from the ground up.

## 🚀 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Design clean, responsive user interfaces with **React**
- Build a modular, maintainable front-end architecture
- Learn and implement best practices in modern web development
- Eventually connect a **backend** (authentication, database, API) to make this a full-stack app

This is a **learning-driven project**, which means the structure, functionality, and technologies used will evolve over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used (So Far)

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – UI framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – lightning-fast dev environment
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – utility-first CSS framework
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) – clean, modern icon library

## 📸 Current Features

- Clean and modern **Login UI**
- Responsive layout
- Interactive input fields with icons
- Styled buttons with hover effects

## 📅 Planned Next Steps

- Add **form validation and state**
- Build a **Create Account** screen
- Hook up authentication with a backend (e.g. Firebase, Express, or Supabase)
- Add user dashboards, workout logs, and goal tracking
- Deploy to web (and maybe mobile)
