# 🏋️ Fitness Tracker UI (React) — **[Deprecated in Favor of Mobile App]**

⚠️ **Note:** This project is no longer actively maintained as I’ve shifted toward building a mobile-first experience. The core functionality has been rebuilt and expanded into a native mobile app:

📱 **Download for iOS:** [AI Fitness App – ExercAIse](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-fitness-app-exercaise/id6745973398)

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was originally designed to demonstrate my ability to:

- Design clean, responsive user interfaces with React  
- Build a modular, maintainable front-end architecture  
- Implement best practices in modern web development  
- Integrate with a backend for full-stack functionality  

Although deprecated, this web project laid the groundwork for the ExercAIse mobile app and helped solidify my full-stack development skills.
